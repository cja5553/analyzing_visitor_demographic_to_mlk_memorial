# Using mobile phone data to trace racial demographics of visitors to Martin Luther King Jr Memorial

Background: Historical parks are critical in providing immersive educational experiences to Americans in an equitable and accessible manner. Many history parks seek to educate Americans of its past struggles, including the struggles faced by African-Americans in their pursuit for equal civil rights. The Martin Luther King Jr Memorial in Washington DC seeks to perform this duty of allowing African Americans to understand and connect with historical struggles during the civil rights movement era. Hence, this study seeks to understand understand if the MLK memorial has served this purpose by analyzing the visitor demographics of the MLK memorial. 

Methods: We elect to use mobile-phone data to analyze the visitor origins of the MLK memorial. We seek to use spatial methods in analyzing our data. Our models of consideration include the Ordinarily Least Square model, the Spatial-lag model, and the spatial-error model.
